## What are tectonic plates?

Tectonic plates are mobile slabs of rock of various shapes and sizes that make up the surface of the earth. These plates float on magma in the mantle. We believe that these plates move over time. These plates move toards, away, and alongside eachother.

## What happens to the land around these boarders?

WHen these tectonic plates move multiple changes in the land can happen. Mountains and volcanos can form when tectonic plates move toards eachother. Earthquakes happen if these tectonic plates rub against each other.
